# Replay

Replay is a very powerful feature in Psi Kit. It allows you to record all the inputs your code receives, and then replay the code from a log file. This allows you to replay the **exact internal state of the robot code**, as it was while the robot was running

### Common Use Cases:
* Replay logs from when a bug occurred, and:
  - Log additional values such as internal state in a calculation
  - Use the IDE debugger to step through the robot code
* Record a log of matches, when live streaming the data is not allowed
* Keep debugging the code when the pesky "*build team*" takes away the robot

### Usage:
1. Use `Logger.addDataReceiver(new RLOGWriter(String fileName))` to record data to a log file 
2. Check the [list of supported devices](/supported.md) to make sure that all of the hardware on your robot has supported wrappers
3. Make sure your hardware is constructed using the *wrapped* `hardwareMap` (subclass `PsiKitOpMode` / `PsiKitLinearOpMode`, or call the equivalent setup before any `hardwareMap.get(...)` calls)
4. Set up your OpMode loop to make sure that hardware gets processed, following the example OpMode on the [usage](/usage.md) page
